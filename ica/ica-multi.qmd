## Exercises (required)

### The story {-}

Though far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state's education system. The `education` dataset contains various education variables for each state:

```{r}
# Import and check out data
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)
```

A codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:

### Exercise 1: SAT scores {-}

#### Part a {-}

Construct a plot of how the average `sat` scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable -- `sat` not `State`!)

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white")

```

#### Part b {-}

Summarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)

+ The range of the data is unusual and seems to be skewed towards both sides, with the middle range of data very empty, meaning people in the data set mostly got either slightly higher than average or lower than average scores, and not many people got average scores. The typical outcome (mean) was just under 900, with 6 students scoring in that range.



### Exercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries {-}

The first question we'd like to answer is: Can the variability in `sat` scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (`expend`) and typical teacher `salary`?

#### Part a {-}

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs expend
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs salary
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot(education, aes(x = salary, y = sat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

#### Part b {-}

What are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?

+ The relationship between SAT scores and spending is negative, meaning that as spending increases, the average expected SAT score decreases. This surprising, especially because I thought that school districts and states that were spending more on education would be scoring higher on the SAT.


### Exercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending *and* Teacher Salaries {-}

Construct *one* visualization of the relationship of `sat` with `salary` *and* `expend`. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, size = salary)) +
  geom_point()

```



### Exercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale {-}

It can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to *discretize* a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into *categories*.

Construct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what's happening here. What happens if you change "2" to "3"?

+ When I change the 2 to a 3, there are now three different trend lines and categories of data created from the `expend` variable.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")

ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```

Describe the trivariate relationship between `sat`, `salary`, and `expend`.

+ There is a positive correlation between `salary` and `expend` variables, and generally as salary increases, expenditure by the school also increases (as can be seen by most of the upper range color variable of `expend` being found on the higher end of the `salary` x-axis). Both of `salary` and `expend` have negative correlation with `sat`, meaning that in general, the higher the expenditure and salary, the lower the SAT score will be.


### Exercise 5: Finally an Explanation {-}

It's strange that SAT scores *seem* to decrease with spending. But we're leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state's students that actually take the SAT. The `fracCat` variable indicates this fraction: `low` (under 15% take the SAT), `medium` (15-45% take the SAT), and `high` (at least 45% take the SAT).

#### Part a {-}

Build a univariate viz of `fracCat` to better understand how many states fall into each category.

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) +
  geom_bar()
```

#### Part b {-}

Build 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between `sat` and `fracCat`. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat, y = sat)) +
  geom_point()
```

#### Part c {-}

Make a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of `sat` with `expend` AND `fracCat`. Highlight the differences in `fracCat` groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\
Does it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) +
  geom_point() +
 geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```

#### Part d {-}

Putting all of this together, explain this example of **Simpsonâ€™s Paradox**. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the *opposite* is true?

+ The SAT scores seemed to be decreasing because the sample that gave results was less selective and biased. The smaller sample of students who had lower funding but still took the SAT was biased towards students who studied and did well on the test. In the categories of states where only up to 15% of people took the SAT, there was a slight positive correlation between higher expenditure and better test results. Within each categorization of the fraction of students who took the SAT, there was a positive trend between expenditure and test score.


## Exercises (optional)

### Exercise 6: Heat Maps {-}

As usual, we've only just scratched the surface! There are lots of other data viz techniques for exploring multivariate relationships. Let's start with a **heat map**.

#### Part a {-}

Run the chunks below. Check out the code, but don't worry about every little detail! NOTES:

-   This is *not* part of the `ggplot()` grammar, making it a bit complicated.
-   If you're curious about what a line in the plot does, comment it out (`#`) and check out what happens!
-   In the plot, for each state (row), each variable (column) is scaled to indicate whether the state has a relative high value (yellow), a relatively low value (purple), or something in between (blues/greens).
-   You can also play with the color scheme. Type `?cm.colors` in the *console* to learn about various options.
-   We'll improve the plot later, so don't spend too much time trying to learn something from this plot.

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}

# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps and the tibble package necessary for heatmaps
library(gplots)
library(tibble)

# Remove the "State" column and use it to label the rows
# Then scale the variables
plot_data <- education |> 
  column_to_rownames("State") |> 
  data.matrix() |> 
  scale()

# Construct heatmap 1
heatmap.2(plot_data,
  dendrogram = "none",
  Rowv = NA, 
  scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, 
  density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), 
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", trace = "none"
)
```

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}
# Construct heatmap 2
heatmap.2(plot_data,
  dendrogram = "none",
  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE
  scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, 
  density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), 
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", trace = "none"
)
```

```{r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}
# Construct heatmap 3
heatmap.2(plot_data,
  dendrogram = "row",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM "none" TO "row"
  Rowv = TRUE,            
  scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, 
  density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), 
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", trace = "none"
)
```

#### Part b {-}

In the final two plots, the states (rows) are rearranged by similarity with respect to these education metrics. The *final* plot includes a **dendrogram** which further indicates *clusters* of similar states. In short, states that have a shorter path to connection are more similar than others.

Putting this all together, what insight do you gain about the education trends across U.S. states? Which states are similar? In what ways are they similar? Are there any outliers with respect to 1 or more of the education metrics?



+<span style="color: red;"> Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota all fall pretty close to each other on the dendrogram, due to their similarities in the data collected. These states are also in the same region of the US, which is not a metric that is measured in the data, but interesting that there is still a connection between the states. I liked the dendrogram because it looked like what I am familiar with seeing in biology for evolution. I wonder if R could be used to make evolutionary hypotheses and diagrams with similar data?</span>

+<span style="color: red;"> Utah and California are both outliers in the ratio of students to teachers that they have, which is made very clear by the bright yellow boxes that they have in this heat map in that category.New York and New Jersey both have similar high levels of expenditure on education. </span>




### Exercise 7: Star plots {-}

Like heat maps, star plots indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state. Thus, we can use star maps to identify similar groups of states, and unusual states!

#### Part a {-}

Construct and check out the star plot below. Note that each state has a "pie", with each segment corresponding to a different variable. The larger a segment, the larger that variable's value is in that state. For example:

-   Check out Minnesota. How does Minnesota's education metrics compare to those in other states? What metrics are relatively high? Relatively low?

+<span style="color: red;"> Minnesota has very high math and verbal and SAT scores, but low frac and fracCat statistics. It has similar proportions of stats to other states in the midwest. </span>

-   What states appear to be similar? Do these observations agree with those that you gained from the heat map?

+<span style="color: red;"> New York and New Jersey appear to have very similar pie charts, as do many of the midwestern states, which is similar to what I saw in the heat maps. </span>


```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 20}
stars(plot_data,
  flip.labels = FALSE,
  key.loc = c(10, 1.5),
  cex = 1, 
  draw.segments = TRUE
)
```

#### Part b {-}

Finally, let's plot the state stars by *geographic* location! What new insight do you gain here?!

+<span style="color: red;"> The pie charts are so small, but I can see the geographic trend of many states in the east matching the trend I noticed in New Jersey and New York, and many of the midwestern states having similar trends. There is a much wider variety of spending and SAT results in the west, much more variation between states, which this method of visualization makes clearer.</span>

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
stars(plot_data,
  flip.labels = FALSE,
  locations = data.matrix(as.data.frame(state.center)),  # added external data to arrange by geo location
  key.loc = c(-110, 28),
  cex = 1, 
  draw.segments = TRUE
)
```
