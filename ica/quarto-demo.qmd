## Intro


**Macalester College** is in the *Twin Cities*.
It has:

- four seasons
- bagpipes
- delightful students

Check it out for yourself:

## Exercise 1: Deduce Quarto features

Check out the appearance and contents of this document. Thoughts?

In the toolbar at the top of this document, **Render** the .qmd file into a .html file. Where is this file stored? Thoughts about its appearance / contents? Can you edit it?

This file is stored in my repository initially created for class, and renders into html, where I cannot edit it.

Toggling between the .qmd and .html files, explain the purpose of the following features in the .qmd file:        

`*`

`**`

`#`

`-`

`\`

`![](url)`

These features appear to make things bold

## Exercise 2: Code

How does this appear in the .qmd? The .html? So...?!

seq(from = 100, to = 1000, by = 50)

They look the same and it's not doing the sequence command. It is simply showing these sequence of characters as a text string.

## Exercise 3: Chunks

Quarto isn't a mind reader -- we must distinguish R code from text.
We do so by putting code inside an **R chunk**:

```{r}
seq(from = 100, to = 1000, by = 50)
```

- Put the `seq()` code in the chunk.
- Press the green arrow in the top right of the chunk. What happens in the qmd?
The qmd shows the processed results of the code.
- Render. What appears in the html: R code, output, or both?
The R code and the output both show up when you render the file, but with slightly different formating than in the qmd


## Exercise 4: Practice

- Use R code to create the following sequence: 10 10 10 10
- Store the sequence as `four_tens`.
- Use an R function (which we haven't learned!) to add up the numbers in `four_tens`.

```{r}
four_tens <- rep(10,4)
sum(four_tens)
```


## Exercise 5: Fix this code

Code is a form of communication, and the code below doesn't cut it.

Put the code in a chunk and fix it.

```{r}
rep(x = 1, times = 10)
seq(from = 100, to = 1000, length = 20)
number_of_students<-27
```



## Exercise 6: Comments

Run the chunk below.
Notice that R ignores anything in a line starting with a pound sign (`#`).
If we took the `#` away we'd get an error!

```{r}
# This is a comment
4 + 5
```

We'll utilize this feature to **comment our code**, i.e. leave short notes about what our code is doing.
Below, replace the `???` with an appropriate comment.

```{r}
# This code calculates what 10 degrees celcius is in fahrenheit
temperature_c <- 10
temperature_f <- temperature_c * 9/5 + 32
temperature_f
```
