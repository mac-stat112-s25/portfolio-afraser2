    "text": "Exercise 1: Research Questions\nLet’s dig into the hikes data, starting with the elevation and difficulty ratings of the hikes:\n\nhead(hikes)\n\n             peak elevation difficulty ascent length time    rating\n1     Mt. Marcy        5344          5   3166   14.8 10.0  moderate\n2 Algonquin Peak       5114          5   2936    9.6  9.0  moderate\n3   Mt. Haystack       4960          7   3570   17.8 12.0 difficult\n4   Mt. Skylight       4926          7   4265   17.9 15.0 difficult\n5 Whiteface Mtn.       4867          4   2535   10.4  8.5      easy\n6       Dix Mtn.       4857          5   2800   13.2 10.0  moderate\n\n\n\nWhat features would we like a visualization of the categorical difficulty rating variable to capture?\n\n\nIt should be in numerical order from lowest to highest difficulty, and the numbers of hikes of different difficulties should be shown together as categories.\n\n\nWhat about a visualization of the quantitative elevation variable?\n\n\nThe peaks should be shown on a number line or in numerical order based on their elevation, from lowest to highest.\nExercise 2: Load tidyverse\nWe’ll address the above questions using ggplot tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message – this is one you’ll get a lot!\n\n# Use the ggplot function\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to use ggplot tools, we have to first load the tidyverse package in which they live. We’ve installed the package but we need to tell R when we want to use it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You’ll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses ggplot().\n\n# Load the package\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nExercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1\nConsider some specific research questions about the difficulty rating of the hikes:\n\nHow many hikes fall into each category?\n\n\n# Shows the number of each discrete value that occurs in the variable difficulty, from the dataset hikes.\ntable(hikes$difficulty)\n\n\n 2  3  4  5  6  7 \n 1  1  9 14 13  8 \n\n\nThere is one hike of difficulty 3, 1 hike of difficulty 2, 9 hikes of rating difficulty rating 4, 14 hikes with difficulty 5, 13 sets with difficulty 13, and 8 hikes with difficulty 7.\n\nAre the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others? Some ratings of hikes are more common than others. Rating 5 is the most common. Low rated hikes are less common.\n\nAll of these questions can be answered with: (1) a bar chart; of (2) the categorical data recorded in the rating column. First, set up the plotting frame:\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink about:\n\nWhat did this do? What do you observe? A blank chart shows up\nWhat, in general, is the first argument of the ggplot() function? Describes the dataset that the data should come from.\nWhat is the purpose of writing x = rating? It labels the x axis\nWhat do you think aes stands for?!? Aesthetics of the chart\nExercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2\nNow let’s add a geometric layer to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot’s theme. To this end, try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\nNOTE:\n\nPay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.\nNot all of these are “good” plots. We’re just exploring ggplot.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The ratings of each chart are shown, but not in the order we might expect. This code adds bars to the graph of the number of occurences of a variable in the designated column.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The \"labs()\" function allows us to designate and write what we want the x and y axis of the chart to be labeled.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Adding the 'fill = \"blue\"' argument to the geom_bar function changes the color of the bars in the chart to a bright blue.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# While the inside of the bars remains bright blue, the \"color = 'orange'\" command creates an orange outline around each of the bars in the chart.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"orange\", fill = \"blue\")  +\n  labs(x = \"Rating\", y = \"Number of hikes\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Adding a theme_minimal() function removes the grey background of the chart.\n\nExercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up\nPart a\nReflect on the ggplot() code.\n\nWhat’s the purpose of the +? When do we use it?\n\nThe + looks like a way to combine functions to each other and add functions from the ggplot code to one another to allow them to work together.\n\nWe added the bars using geom_bar()? Why “geom”?\n\nGeometric lets ggplot know that we want the graph to be numerically proportional in showing values.\n\nWhat does labs() stand for?\n\nLabels, as in labeling the x and y axis.\n\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill?\n\nColor changes the outline of a bar on the chart, and fill changes the whole color inside each bar.\nPart b\nIn general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a categorical variable:\n\nobserved categories: What categories did we observe? Moderate, easy, and difficult.\nvariability between categories: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?\nThe numbers of easy and difficult hikes were about the same, but the number of moderate hikes was much higher.\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.\n\nThe most common rating of hike was “Moderate” and there were over 25 hikes with that rating. There were around 11 hikes rated easy and 8 labeled difficult.\nPart c\nIs there anything you don’t like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.\n\nThe ratings are not labeled as expected. It would have been improved if the x-axis order had moderate in the middle.\nExercise 6: Sad Bar Chart\nLet’s now consider some research questions related to the quantitative elevation variable:\n\nAmong the hikes, what’s the range of elevation and how are the hikes distributed within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, “normally”)?\nWhat’s a typical elevation?\nAre there any outliers, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?\n\nHere:\n\nConstruct a bar chart of the quantitative elevation variable.\nExplain why this might not be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nThis is not a very effective visualization because it doesn’t give us the numbers of each elevation. Although I can see some elevations had two hikes at that elevation, the spread of the y axis is so big that it makes the graph hard to interpret precisely and with the numbers that we want to see. It might be more helpful to separate the distinct numbers into groups and show larger bars that are easier to interpret the real numbers of.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation\nQuantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It’s typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we’ve observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:\n\nPart a\nLet’s dig into some details.\n\nHow many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?\n\nAccording to the above histogram, 6 hikes from the hikes dataset have an elevation between 4500 and 4700\n\nHow many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?\n\nOnly 2 hikes from the dataset have an elevation of at least 5100 feet\nPart b\nNow the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a quantitative variable:\n\n\ntypical outcome: Where’s the center of the data points? What’s typical? The most typical data point in this set is a hike between 3900 and 4100 feet.\n\nvariability & range: How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes? The outcomes are not massively spread out, and have a range of about 2000 feet. The minimum elevation of a hike is about 3700 feet and the maximum is about 5500 feet.\n\nshape: How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)? The distribution is mostly symmetric but slightly right skewed.\n\noutliers: Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small? It doesn’t appear that there are any outliers, as there are no large empty gaps between filled bars on the x axis, showing that all the data points are next to other data points on the designated scale.\n\nWe must then translate this information into the context of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.\n\nHikes in the Adirondacks range from between 3700 feet to 5500 feet, with the greatest number falling between 3900 and 4100 feet in elevation. Most of the hikes seem to be clustered between 3900 and 4900 feet in elevation, but on either side of that range there are not any outliers, or hikes that have a drastically higher or lower elevation, set apart from the other data points.\nExercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1\n2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to intuit what line you can tack on to the below frame of elevation to add a histogram layer. Don’t forget a +. If it doesn’t come to you within 2 minutes, no problem – all will be revealed in the next exercise.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n    geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2\nLet’s build some histograms. Try each chunk below, one by one. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Instead of making a bar plot, the addition of `geom_histogram` created a histogram with discrete categories on the x axis.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The addition of the argument `color = \"white\"` created white lines around the bars of the histogram, which helps differentiate them from each other and keep them from looking like a blob.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", fill = \"blue\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The addition of the `fill = \"blue\"` argument filled each of the bars with a bright blue color.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The addition of the `labs()` function added text to the x and y axis of the histogram\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 1000) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# The addition of the `binwidth = 1000` argument to the geom_histogram function changed the range of each of the bins into which the points are categorized to 1000 instead of 30, as the default text above was telling us.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 5) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# This change of binwidth from 1000 to 5 made the width of the bins into which the numbers are categorized much narrower.\n\n\n# COMMENT on the change in the code and the corresponding change in the plot\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\n  labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Switching the binwidth argument to 200 created reasonable sized bins that split the numerical data into categories that each cover 200 distinct values, such as 4500 to 4700, and 4700 to 4900, and so on.\n\nExercise 10: Histogram Follow-up\n\nWhat function added the histogram layer / geometry? geom_histogram\n\nWhat’s the difference between color and fill? color changes the color of the lines on the outside of each of the bars and fill changes the color of the inside blocky part of the bars.\nWhy does adding color = \"white\" improve the visualization? It helps keep the bars from becoming too blocky and running together, especially when there are similar numbers in adjacent bins.\nWhat did binwidth do? Binwidth changes the width of inclusion of each category. Wider bins mean fewer bars across the whole x axis of the histogram.\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)? It is difficult to see the actual trends and distribution. It gets down to being just about as useful as stating the range of the whole dataset, which doesn’t help us see outliers or clusters within the data.\nWhy does the histogram become ineffective if the binwidth is too small (e.g. 5 feet)? There is almost no point in making the bins and the discrete values themselves may as well be shown, because it is harder to make generalizations about the number of data points in each range and is thus harder to see trends in the data.\nExercise 11: Density Plots\nDensity plots are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the “density” of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve always equals 1 and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.\nCheck out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation – it’s a relative measure. The higher the density, the more common are elevations in that range.\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nINTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to geom_bar() and geom_histogram(), how do you anticipate the following code will change the plot?\n\nI think that the first line will change the color of the curved line on the plot itself to blue, and the second line will change the area underneath the line, between the line and the x axis, to a bright orange color.\n\ngeom_density(color = \"blue\")\ngeom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\nTRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?\n\n\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\n  geom_density(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_density(fill = \"orange\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the typical elevation, variability / range in elevations, and shape of the distribution of elevations within this range? The typical, or most common elevation is just over 4000 feet. The elevations are definitely right skewed, although there don’t seem to be any massive outliers. The data is clustered between 4100 and 4500 feet and the number of hikes above this elevation drop rapidly. The density plot also tells us that the range is between about 3700 and 5700 feet.\nExercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms\nThe histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each? Density plots do a good job of showing the general trends with a smooth line and make it easier to understand the general split of the data without being too distracted by outliers. Histograms will show outliers in their own discrete categories and allow you to see clusters of data. I imagine histograms would be less useful for detecting outliers if there were a huge number of data points in one bin, compared to 1 in another; a density plot would help smooth out any huge excess in one bin and might help trends be seen in large data sets more easily. I visually prefer histograms, at least for the example of trails in the Adirondacks from this practice set.\nExercise 13: Code = communication\nWe obviously won’t be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar general structure (where the details can change):\n\nggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + \n  geom___(color = \"___\", fill = \"___\") + \n  labs(x = \"___\", y = \"___\")\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to indent or tab the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why? This is helpful so that we can see what code functions build on each other and which ones are their own separate functions.\n\n\n# YUCK\nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +\ngeom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) +\nlabs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not necessary to the code working, it’s common, good practice to put a line break after each + (counterexample below). Why? If it is all in the same line as in the example below, if gets hard to mentally separate the sections from one another and identify their unique purposes and functions. If you were looking for one in particular to edit, it may be hard ot find.\n\n\n# YUCK \nggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = \"Elevation (feet)\", y = \"Number of hikes\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 14: Practice\nPart a\nPractice your viz skills to learn about some of the variables in one of the following datasets from the previous class:\n\n# Data on students in this class\nsurvey &lt;- read.csv(\"https://hash-mac.github.io/stat112site-s25/data/survey.csv\")\n\n# World Cup data\nworld_cup &lt;- read.csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2022/2022-11-29/worldcups.csv\")\n\nggplot(survey, aes(x = minutes_to_campus)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\", binwidth = 2) +\n  labs(x = \"Time to campus (min)\", y = \"Number of students\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(survey, aes(x = hangout)) +\n  geom_bar(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = \"Favorite Hangout Spot\", y = \"Number of students\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of data from Exercise 14 Part a\n\nI learned about two variables from the data in the class survey, the time it takes for them to get to campus and their ideal hangout spot. I learned that the vast majority of students in the class live within 5 minutes from campus, while over 15 of the students live 0 minutes from campus, presumably on campus itself. Over 20 students in the class have the beach as their ideal hangout spot, and the fewest students, only about 3, said that of the options given, a prairie would be their ideal hangout spot.\nPart b\nCheck out the RStudio Data Visualization cheat sheet to learn more features of ggplot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck → Commit → Push\n\n\n\nWhen done, don’t forgot to click Render Book and check the resulting HTML files.

Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = repub_pct_20)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county.

Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\nThe relationship is strong between who voted republican in 2016 and who did in 2020.\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\nThe relationship is positive, meaning that counties that voted republican in 2016 were also more likely to vote republican in 2020\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)\nIn Texas, more counties voted republican in 2020 than in 2016, which indicates that there may have been some event that happened between these years that changed people’s point of view on issues.\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"orange\")\n# \n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_rent)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"orange\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = median_age)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"orange\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using method = 'gam' and formula = 'y ~ s(x, bs = \"cs\")'\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nA scatterplot is not a good solution for making this visualization because the historical variable is not able to be shown on a numbered axis. Categorical variables need to be shown using colors or symbols. I think a bar chart would be the best way to show the historical trends in correlation with the repub_pct_20 variable.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.\n\nI have learned that counties that historically voted Republican were more likely to vote republican in 2020, but there were more negative outliers, counties that did not have high republican votes in 2020 but did have a strong history of voting republican in the past.\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.) Try to adjust the code chunk below, which starts with a density plot of repub_pct_20 alone, to re-create this image.\n\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 9: Quantitative vs Categorical – Density Plots\nWork through the chunks below and address the comments therein.\n\n# Name two \"bad\" things about this plot\n# 1 I cannot see the overlapped sections. I think there may be a background to the \"blue\" `historical` tagged section but I cannot see it.\n# 2 The key says that the fill of blue is pink, which is not intuitive at all.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n# What does scale_fill_manual do?\n# Changes the color so that blue is blue, purple is purple, and red is red.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does alpha = 0.5 do?\n# Alpha changes the transparency of each of the filled in density plots.\n# Play around with different values of alpha, between 0 and 1\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\n\n# What does facet_wrap do?!\n# facet_wrap creates a whole new plot for each historical categorization\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_density() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# Let's try a similar grouping strategy with a histogram instead of density plot.\n# Why is this terrible?\n# I can't compare the numbers of blue and purple votes because they are all displaced already by red vote numbers\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = historical)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"blue\", \"purple\", \"red\"))\n\nExercise 10\nWe’ve now learned 3 (of many) ways to visualize the relationship between a quantitative and categorical variable: side-by-side violins, boxplots, and density plots.\n\nWhich do you like best?\nI like transparent density plots the best.\nWhat is one pro of density plots relative to boxplots?\nThey are more visually appealing and show trends very intuitively.\nWhat is one con of density plots relative to boxplots?\nThey do not give you very precise numbers or statistics about the data, you can’t see the median or percentile ranges very intuitively, you are just guessing on those.\nExercise 11: Categorical vs Categorical – Intuition Check\nFinally, let’s simply explore who won each county in 2020 (winner_20) and how this breaks down by historical voting trends in the state. That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check. Adjust the code below to recreate the following two plots.\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 1: adjust this to recreate the top plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Plot 2: adjust this to recreate the bottom plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() + \n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 12: Categorical vs Categorical\nConstruct the following 4 bar plot visualizations.\n\n# A stacked bar plot\n# How are the \"historical\" and \"winner_20\" variables mapped to the plot, i.e. what roles do they play?\n# \"historical\" is shown on the x axis and is the independent variable, so we are interested in how it affects the winner in 2020, which is shown by colors on the bars, and is the independent variable.\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n# A faceted bar plot\nggplot(elections, aes(x = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  facet_wrap(~ historical)\n\n\n# A side-by-side bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")\n\n\n# A proportional bar plot\n# Note the new argument to geom_bar\nggplot(elections, aes(x = historical, fill = winner_20)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n\nPart a\nName one pro and one con of using the “proportional bar plot” instead of one of the other three options.\n\nA pro is that you can compare easily the percentages and proportions of different categories between historical trends in this case. A con is that you don’t get any idea of the actual number of counties, and how big the historical data sets are compared to each other.\nPart b\nWhat’s your favorite bar plot from part and why?\n\nI like the “dodge” bar graph because it lets me see democrat versus republican votes in 2020 very easily among counties with the same historical background.\nExercise 13: Practice (now or later)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecide\n\n\n\nDecide what’s best for you:\n\nTry this extra practice now.\nReflect on the above exercises and come back to this extra practice later (but before the next class).\n\n\n\nImport some daily weather data from a few locations in Australia:\n\nweather &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv\")\n\nConstruct plots that address the research questions in each chunk. You might make multiple plots–there are many ways to do things!. However, don’t just throw spaghetti at the wall.\nReflect before doing anything. What types of variables are these?

    "text": "7.2 Exercises (optional)\nThe above visualizations are foundational and important. But they’re not the only way to visualize the variables in our dataset.\nOptional Exercise 1: Many Categories\nSuppose we wanted to better understand how the 2020 Republican support varied from county to county within each state. Since repub_pct_20 is quantitative and state_abbr is categorical, we could make a density plot of repub_pct_20 for each state. Reflect on why this is bad.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\nWarning: Groups with fewer than two data points have been dropped.\n\n\nWarning in max(ids, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to max; returning\n-Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA facet wrap would also be bad!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(~ state_abbr)\n\nWarning: Groups with fewer than two data points have been dropped.\n\n\nWarning in max(ids, na.rm = TRUE): no non-missing arguments to max; returning\n-Inf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we want to compare the distribution of some quantitative outcome among many groups / categories, a ridgeline plot can be a good option. These are also called joy plots, named after the album cover for “Unknown Pleasures” by Joy Division. (Look it up!) To make a ridgeline plot, we can use the geom_density_ridges() function from the ggridges package.\n\n# Install ggridges package\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\n# Make our first joy plot\n# THINK: What DON'T you like about this?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density_ridges()\n\n\n# Let's put the states in order by Republican support, not alphabet\n# How do you think fct_reorder works?

    "text": "The story\nThough far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state’s education system. The education dataset contains various education variables for each state:\n\n# Import and check out data\neducation &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv\")\nhead(education)\n\n       State expend ratio salary frac verbal math  sat  fracCat\n1    Alabama  4.405  17.2 31.144    8    491  538 1029   (0,15]\n2     Alaska  8.963  17.6 47.951   47    445  489  934 (45,100]\n3    Arizona  4.778  19.3 32.175   27    448  496  944  (15,45]\n4   Arkansas  4.459  17.1 28.934    6    482  523 1005   (0,15]\n5 California  4.992  24.0 41.078   45    417  485  902  (15,45]\n6   Colorado  5.443  18.4 34.571   29    462  518  980  (15,45]\n\n\nA codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:\n\nExercise 1: SAT scores\nPart a\nConstruct a plot of how the average sat scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable – sat not State!)\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = sat)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"white\")\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nSummarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)\n\nThe range of the data is unusual and seems to be skewed towards both sides, with the middle range of data very empty, meaning people in the data set mostly got either slightly higher than average or lower than average scores, and not many people got average scores. The typical outcome (mean) was just under 900, with 6 students scoring in that range.\nExercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries\nThe first question we’d like to answer is: Can the variability in sat scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (expend) and typical teacher salary?\nPart a\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs expend\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct a plot of sat vs salary\n# Include a \"best fit linear regression model\" (HINT: method = \"lm\")\nggplot(education, aes(x = salary, y = sat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nWhat are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?\n\nThe relationship between SAT scores and spending is negative, meaning that as spending increases, the average expected SAT score decreases. This surprising, especially because I thought that school districts and states that were spending more on education would be scoring higher on the SAT.\nExercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending and Teacher Salaries\nConstruct one visualization of the relationship of sat with salary and expend. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, size = salary)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale\nIt can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to discretize a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into categories.\nConstruct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what’s happening here. What happens if you change “2” to “3”?\n\nWhen I change the 2 to a 3, there are now three different trend lines and categories of data created from the expend variable.\n\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 2))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\nDescribe the trivariate relationship between sat, salary, and expend.\n\nThere is a positive correlation between salary and expend variables, and generally as salary increases, expenditure by the school also increases (as can be seen by most of the upper range color variable of expend being found on the higher end of the salary x-axis). Both of salary and expend have negative correlation with sat, meaning that in general, the higher the expenditure and salary, the lower the SAT score will be.\nExercise 5: Finally an Explanation\nIt’s strange that SAT scores seem to decrease with spending. But we’re leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state’s students that actually take the SAT. The fracCat variable indicates this fraction: low (under 15% take the SAT), medium (15-45% take the SAT), and high (at least 45% take the SAT).\nPart a\nBuild a univariate viz of fracCat to better understand how many states fall into each category.\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nBuild 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between sat and fracCat. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat, y = sat)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart c\nMake a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of sat with expend AND fracCat. Highlight the differences in fracCat groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\nDoes it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?\n\nggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) +\n  geom_point() +\n geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart d\nPutting all of this together, explain this example of Simpson’s Paradox. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the opposite is true?\n\nThe SAT scores seemed to be decreasing because the sample that gave results was less selective and biased. The smaller sample of students who had lower funding but still took the SAT was biased towards students who studied and did well on the test. In the categories of states where only up to 15% of people took the SAT, there was a slight positive correlation between higher expenditure and better test results. Within each categorization of the fraction of students who took the SAT, there was a positive trend between expenditure and test score.",

    "text": "8.2 Exercises (optional)\nExercise 6: Heat Maps\nAs usual, we’ve only just scratched the surface! There are lots of other data viz techniques for exploring multivariate relationships. Let’s start with a heat map.\nPart a\nRun the chunks below. Check out the code, but don’t worry about every little detail! NOTES:\n\nThis is not part of the ggplot() grammar, making it a bit complicated.\nIf you’re curious about what a line in the plot does, comment it out (#) and check out what happens!\nIn the plot, for each state (row), each variable (column) is scaled to indicate whether the state has a relative high value (yellow), a relatively low value (purple), or something in between (blues/greens).\nYou can also play with the color scheme. Type ?cm.colors in the console to learn about various options.\nWe’ll improve the plot later, so don’t spend too much time trying to learn something from this plot.\n\n\n# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps and the tibble package necessary for heatmaps\nlibrary(gplots)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gplots'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    lowess\n\nlibrary(tibble)\n\n# Remove the \"State\" column and use it to label the rows\n# Then scale the variables\nplot_data &lt;- education |&gt; \n  column_to_rownames(\"State\") |&gt; \n  data.matrix() |&gt; \n  scale()\n\n# Construct heatmap 1\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = NA, \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 2\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"none\",\n  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE\n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Construct heatmap 3\nheatmap.2(plot_data,\n  dendrogram = \"row\",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM \"none\" TO \"row\"\n  Rowv = TRUE,            \n  scale = \"column\",\n  keysize = 0.7, \n  density.info = \"none\",\n  col = hcl.colors(256), \n  margins = c(10, 20),\n  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),\n  sepcolor = \"white\", trace = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nIn the final two plots, the states (rows) are rearranged by similarity with respect to these education metrics. The final plot includes a dendrogram which further indicates clusters of similar states. In short, states that have a shorter path to connection are more similar than others.\nPutting this all together, what insight do you gain about the education trends across U.S. states? Which states are similar? In what ways are they similar? Are there any outliers with respect to 1 or more of the education metrics?\n+ Nebraska, Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, North Dakota, and South Dakota all fall pretty close to each other on the dendrogram, due to their similarities in the data collected. These states are also in the same region of the US, which is not a metric that is measured in the data, but interesting that there is still a connection between the states. I liked the dendrogram because it looked like what I am familiar with seeing in biology for evolution. I wonder if R could be used to make evolutionary hypotheses and diagrams with similar data?\n+ Utah and California are both outliers in the ratio of students to teachers that they have, which is made very clear by the bright yellow boxes that they have in this heat map in that category.New York and New Jersey both have similar high levels of expenditure on education. \nExercise 7: Star plots\nLike heat maps, star plots indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state. Thus, we can use star maps to identify similar groups of states, and unusual states!\nPart a\nConstruct and check out the star plot below. Note that each state has a “pie”, with each segment corresponding to a different variable. The larger a segment, the larger that variable’s value is in that state. For example:\n\nCheck out Minnesota. How does Minnesota’s education metrics compare to those in other states? What metrics are relatively high? Relatively low?\n\n+ Minnesota has very high math and verbal and SAT scores, but low frac and fracCat statistics. It has similar proportions of stats to other states in the midwest. \n\nWhat states appear to be similar? Do these observations agree with those that you gained from the heat map?\n\n+ New York and New Jersey appear to have very similar pie charts, as do many of the midwestern states, which is similar to what I saw in the heat maps. \n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  key.loc = c(10, 1.5),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart b\nFinally, let’s plot the state stars by geographic location! What new insight do you gain here?!\n+ The pie charts are so small, but I can see the geographic trend of many states in the east matching the trend I noticed in New Jersey and New York, and many of the midwestern states having similar trends. There is a much wider variety of spending and SAT results in the west, much more variation between states, which this method of visualization makes clearer.\n\nstars(plot_data,\n  flip.labels = FALSE,\n  locations = data.matrix(as.data.frame(state.center)),  # added external data to arrange by geo location\n  key.loc = c(-110, 28),\n  cex = 1, \n  draw.segments = TRUE\n)",
